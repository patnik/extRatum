## Overview

`extRatum` is a package used to provide summary statistics of local geospatial features within a given geographic area. It does so by calculating the area covered by a target geospatial feature (i.e. buildings, parks, lakes, etc.). The geospatial features can be of any type of geospatial data, including point, polygon or line data. 


## Installation
The easiest way to get extRatum is to install it from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("extRatum")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install 
the development version of extRatum from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("patnik/extRatum")
```

## Usage

Following this [link](https://github.com/patnik/extRatum_examples) you can access two example notebooks that demonstrate functionalities of the package.
